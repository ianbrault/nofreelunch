# No Free Lunch

[Check it out in action on YouTube](https://youtu.be/SNV4IanWhnA)

We were always annoyed by struggling to figure out who paid what when we went out to dinner with our friends, and Venmo's lack of multiple users with different amounts per transaction exacerbates this difficulty. We wanted to create a product that would make splitting the bill between friends seamless and fun. 

After the waiter brings you your check, you simply take a picture of your restaurant receipt, and the app creates a list of all the items your party ordered. You can then add friends you've already eaten with before to the meal, or search for new friends across the app. Once you find your friends, you can quickly tap through the items ordered during the meal and assign one to each friend. The app keeps track of whose been assigned to what, calculates tax + tip, and sends an individual charge request to each friend. Each friend can complete this charge request with their No Free Lunch account balance or bank account, and you get paid.
