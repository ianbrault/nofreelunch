"CREATE " 
{
    "username" : ,
    "email" : ,
    "epass" : ,
    "payment_source_token1" : ,
    "payment_source_token2" : ,
    "legal_entity": {
        "address" : {
            "city" : ,
            "line1" : ,
            "postal_code" : ,
            "state" : 
        }
        "dob" : {
            "day" : ,
            "month" : ,
            "year" : 
        }
        "first_name" : , 
        "last_name" : ,
        "ssn_last_4" : , 
    }
    "tos_acceptance" : {"date" : [todays date]}
}
    
    This creates a user in the database with the above info. We need 2 payment source tokens for the same account because
    we need to create one Customer account for the user to make payments and one Connect Custom account to accept payments.
    Returns an ERROR if fields are incorrect, FAILURE if the username/email already exist in the system, or "SUCCESS - User 
    [username] created" on successful account creation.

"GETUSER " + 
{ 
    "user_id" : [can be either username or email],
    "flag" : [must be either VERB or SHORT] 
}
    Search for a user (by username or email) in the database. 
    If the user is not in the database, we always return FAILURE
    If the user is found, the behavior depends on the presence of the trailing value
    1.) If the flag is VERB, we return "SUCESS" + a newline + the entire JSON object associated with the user
    2.) If the flag is SHORT, we only return "SUCCESS" + a newline + the encrypted version of the user's password

"UPDATE " + 
{
    "deltas" : [list of changed fields - strings],
    "username" : [username],
    "email" : [email],
    "name" : [name],
    "payment1" : [first token for payment],
    "payment2" : [second token for payment]
}
    Note that we cannot let the user update the username AND email at the same time, otherwise we won't be able to access them.
    We need the "searchby" value to tell the database how to reference the user - if its "U", the username is unchanged, and if it's
    "E", the email is unchanged. Also note that if one of payment1 or payment2 is changed, both must be changed, and they are supposed
    to match to the same bank account. Returns "FAILURE" + error message for variety of failures, "SUCCESS" on success

"ADDFRIEND " +
{
    "searcher" : [person searching for a friend],
    "searchee" : [person added as a friend]
}
    Searches for a user to add as a friend. If searchee exists, we return "SUCCESS" and add them as one of searcher's friends. 
    If searchee doesn't exist, we just return "FAILURE".

"CHARGE " + 
{
    "charger" : [user making the charge(s) - string] 
    "charge_list" : [ {"chargee" : [string] , "amount" : [dollar amount]} , ...]
}
    Sends a charge request from charger to every chargee in the list for the amount in the list. As indicated in the request signature, there must be a specific dollar amount expressed in [0-9]+\.[0-9]{2}. Returns "CHARGEID " + a list of whitespace-separated integer, which are the unique charge IDs associated with each charge.

"COMPLETE " + 
{
    "payer" : [person paying - string],
    "payee" : [person getting paid - string],
    "charge_number"
    "method" : [one of "BANK" | "NFLBAL"]
}
    Checks if a charge exists from the payee to the payer in the amount given. If it does, it tries to complete the charge through the following process:
    1.) If method is BANK, it takes charges the payers bank account and completes
    2.) If method is NFLBAL, it charges the balance and completes IF the balance is sufficient to cover the charge.
    If the above steps succeed, it credits the NFL balance of the payee, removes the charge, and returns SUCCESS.
    ^^If any of the above steps fail, it does not remove the charge and returns FAILURE

"TRANSFER " +
{
    "user" : [user making transfer to bank],
    "amount" : [amount transferred out of NFL account]
}
    If the user has an NFL balance larger than [amount], we intiate a bank transfer out of the NFL account to the user's bank account and return SUCCESS.
    Otherwise, we return FAILURE and do nothing.
