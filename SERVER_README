#   - Current debts owed by others to user (outstanding_reqs) - A dictionary from payids to (user, amount) 2-tuples, where

User Server API:

CREATE [username] [email] [firstname] [lastname] [payment_source_token]
This creates a user in the database with the above info

SEARCH [searcher] [searchee] [optionally 1 of "FRIEND" OR "SHORT"]
Search for a searchee (by username or email, according to type) in the database. 
If the user is not in the database, we always return FAILURE
If the user is found, the behavior depends on the presence of the trailing value
1.) If there is no trailing value, "SUCCESS" + the JSON value of the user is returned (used for checking what's happened to the user)
2.) If the trailing value is FRIEND, searcher adds searchee as a friend, and then returns SUCCESS
3.) If the trailing value is SHORT, only SUCCESS is returned (used for checking whether a user exists)

UPDATE [username] [fields...]
where user is the username and fields are a list of key value pairs separated by spaces, whose keys can be any of the following:
    - EMAIL - value is an email string
    - NAME - value is the user's name
    - PAYMENT - we can update the user's preferred bank account with a token from stripe.js

CHARGE [user_making_charge] (chargee, amount)...
Sends a charge request from user_making_charge to every chargee in the list for the amount in the list. As indicated in the request signature, there must be a specific dollar amount expressed in [0-9]+\.[0-9]{2}

COMPLETE [payer] [payee] [amount] [method = BANK | NFLBAL]
Checks if a charge exists from the payee to the payer in the amount given. If it does, it tries to complete the charge through the following process:
1.) If method is BANK, it takes charges the payers bank account and completes
2.) If method is NFLBAL, it charges the balance and completes IF the balance is sufficient to cover the charge.
If the above steps succeed, it credits the NFL balance of the payee, removes the charge, and returns SUCESS.
^^If any of the above steps fail, it does not remove the charge and returns FAILURE

TRANSFER [user] [amount]
If the user has an NFL balance larger than [amount], we intiate a bank transfer out of the NFL account to the user's bank account and return SUCCESS.
Otherwise, we return FAILURE and do nothing.
